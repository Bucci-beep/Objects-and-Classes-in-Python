This system practices the use of Inheritance by having a parent class: Person and subclasses: Member and Librarian
Base Class: Person
Attributes: first, last, email
    Librarian: Inherits from Person, with an extra attribute: employee_id

    Member: Inherits from Person, with an extra attribute: membership_id

Extra functionality:

    Both Librarian and Member should have a fullname() method.

    Librarian has a method issue_book(book_title).

    Member has a method borrow_book(book_title).
