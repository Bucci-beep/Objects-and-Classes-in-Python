The Appliance Usage Logger is a simple Python application for tracking
how long appliances have been used. Each appliance is represented by a
class with attributes for its name, power rating, and accumulated
usage hours, plus methods to log usage, reset the counter, and display the current state.

Call log_usage(hours) to add hours

Call reset_usage() to zero out usage

Call info() to see the current status
