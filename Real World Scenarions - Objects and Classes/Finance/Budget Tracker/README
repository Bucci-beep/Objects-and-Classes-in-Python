# Budget Tracker

A simple Python command‑line application to manage spending within predefined categories using object‑oriented design.
Each `BudgetCategory` tracks expenses against a set limit and reports remaining funds.

## Features

- Create budget categories with names and spending limits
- Add expenses to categories with validation
- Calculate and display remaining budget per category
- View a summary of category name, limit, total spent, and remaining balance


- Use `add_expense(amount)` to record spending
- Call `remaining_budget()` to get available funds
- Call `info()` to see a detailed report

- Attributes:
  - `category_name` (str): Name of the budget group
  - `limit` (float): Maximum allowed spending
  - `expenses` (list of float): Logged expense amounts

- Methods:
  - `add_expense(amount)`: Add a positive expense
  - `remaining_budget()`: Returns limit minus total expenses
  - `info()`: Prints category summary

## Example

```python
from budget import BudgetCategory

food = BudgetCategory("Food", 250.00)
food.add_expense(20.50)
food.add_expense(15.00)
food.info()
```
